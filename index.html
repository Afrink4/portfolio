    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Afrin Khan, a senior in design .  I love exploring new design trends and experimenting with different mediums, whether it’s digital illustration or branding projects. When I’m not working, you can find me hiking the beautiful Pacific Northwest trails, indulging in my favorite coffee shops, or getting lost in a good book. I’m always eager to collaborate and connect with other creatives, so feel free to reach out!</p>
